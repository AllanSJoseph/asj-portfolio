This server provides 15 tools for Claude or any LLM's to do CRUD operations on the Inventory Management System Database. The server also uses Pydantic based validation to validate LLM inputs. The server is built using Python and uses Anthropic's MCP SDK to provide the tools. The server is designed to be used with any LLM that supports MCP. This server can be easily used to build LLM applications that require CRUD operations on a database.",
